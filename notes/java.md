# Core Java

## Introduction

### Definitions
- **Virtual Machine:** a software program that mimics hardware
- **JVM:** Java Virtual Machine lets you run the code you write on any platform.
- **JRE:** Java Runtime Environment provides the components needed to run any Java application. It includes the Java Virtual Machine.
- **JDK:** Java Development Kit, a library used in all Java software development. Every JDK includes a corresponding JRE with its virtual machine.
- **SDK:** Software Development Kit, a library for writing software. The JDK and the Android Development Kit are examples of an SDK.
- **IDE:** Integrated Development Environment, a tool like Eclipse or Netbeans to aid in software development. It lets you write code and test it using the JVM.

## Getting Started with Java

### Definitions
- **Source code:** the code that you write in the Java Language.
- **Compiler:** a software program that turns the source code you write into Java bytecode.
- **bytecode:** the code that the compiler creates for the JVM to read on the target computer.
- **variable:** a container that you specify for holding a particular type of data.
- **keyword:** a reserved word in Java that means something specific to the compiler.
- **literal:** a source code representation of a value, for example a number or text.
- **method signature:** the declaration part of a method that specifies its name, any input and output variables and other important information about the method the compiler needs to know.

### How Code is Structured in Java
- Projects contain packages
- Packages contain source code files
- Source code files contain classes
- Classes contain methods
- Methods contain statements
- Statements contain keywords, literal values, operators and identifiers

## It Starts With Main

### Definitions
- method: A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
- modifier: a keyword that alters some aspect of a class, method or variable
- scope: the level of visibility of a class, method or variable.
- public: modifier specifying that the scope of a class, method or variable is that it is available to anyone.
- static: specifying that a class does not need to be created in memory (instantiated) before using.
- void: the return type declaration that means a method does not return some value.
- camel case: each word in an identifier is capitalized
