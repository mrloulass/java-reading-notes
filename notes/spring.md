# Spring

-  It is an application framework that is divided into modules. Spring Framework provides foundational support for different application architectures, including messaging, transactional data and persistence, and web architecture.
- It's packed with some nice features like Dependency Injection, and out of the box modules like:
  - Spring JDBC
  - Spring MVC
  - Spring Security
  - Spring AOP
  - Spring ORM
  - Spring Test

## Introduction to Spring Tools

### Spring JDBC (Java Database Connectivity )
- manages all of the low-level details starting from opening the connection, preparing and executing the SQL statement, processing exceptions, handling transactions, and closing the connection.

### Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

### Spring Security
- customizable authentication and access control framework. It focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications and can easily be extended to meet custom security requirements.

### Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming )
-  includes breaking down program logic into distinct parts called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns, which are conceptually separate from the application's business logic.

### Spring MVC Test
- can write and run integration tests that test controllers without explicitly starting a servlet container.

## Spring Tool Suite (STS)
- is an Eclipse-based IDE that is optimized for developing Spring framework-based projects.
