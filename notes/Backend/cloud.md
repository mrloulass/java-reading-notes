## Cloud Hosting Platforms
- Cloud providers offer services to their customers in a general pay-per-usage model so the customerâ€™s companies can scale up and down on an as-needed basis dependent on usage, business requirements, and growth of the organization. 
- use a virtualization software
- servers that can be deployed quickly, backed up regularly, and scaled to size
- hardware is no longer the constraint, as the cloud provider supplies near limitless computing and networking resources virtually with additional capacity being able to be procured instantly to meet any new demands on the systems.
- Cloud Providers:
  - AWS (Amazon Web Services)
  - Microsoft Azure 
  - Google 
  - IBM Db2
  - Oracle

## Cloud Databases
- key reasons that cloud databases provide an edge for many organizations over the implementation of on-premise database solutions.
### Ease of access
- service reaches nearly all locations in the world and provides quick, efficient access through strategic placement of datacenters, content distribution locations, and network endpoints
### Scalability
- essentially provides unlimited computer and storage capability to the customer base as they can choose the appropriate size for the server in the cloud platform portal and they can scale it on the fly as needed.
### Disaster recovery
- cloud databases have a default configuration that includes redundant backups, read-only copies, and snapshots to ensure that in the event of any failures that the data can be captured and effectively restored.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)
